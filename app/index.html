    <p class="paragraph paragraph--black">There has never been a greater cause of despair than the Great Emu War of '32. During the faithful month of
      October,
      the Emu Republic seized half the fertile territory of Western Australia, with a force that outnumbered Australia
      3000
      to 1.</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--black">The invading force consumed and destroyed vast amounts of farming land, from a country that was already
      suffering from
      World War I. Its people starving, Australia had no choice but to declare war - a choice they ultimately
      regretted.</p>

  <section class="cause-of-war">
    <h1 class="heading heading--red">How the War Began</h1>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--white">After the conclusion of World War I, soldiers returned home and took up the life of farmers, wishing only to know a
    peaceful and simple life. Now no longer soldiers, they served their country in a different capacity - they produced
    wheat.</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--white">Australia was in the early stages of the Great Depression, and many people were suffering. The wheat provided by the
    farmers was desperately needed by the Australian people. The ex-soldiers worked hard to provide for them, and for a
    little while, it seemed as if Australia would pull through - but they were unaware of the threat that loomed near.</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--white">The Emu Republic, whom Australia had maintained a tentative peace with, had always coveted the fertile soil upon which
    these farms were built. Their leader, Lord High Emu, was a cunning and vicious bird. He showed no mercy, striking when
    Australia was at its weakest.</p>
    <div class="cause-of-war__section">
      <p class="paragraph paragraph--white">The invasion happened on the 21st of October, 1932. At the break of dawn, a battalion of 20,000 emu warriors attacked
      the farming outposts of Chandler and Walgoolan. They faced no resistance, seizing the land with ease. The emu battalion
      was a greedy and merciless foe. They consumed a great number of crops, destroying the rest out of spite.</p>

  <section class="preparation">
    <h1 class="heading heading--black">Battle Preparation</h1>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--black">The desperate farmers, who had only just escaped the terrors of war, were now facing another menace. Knowing that they
    were desperately outnumbered, they were forced to leave their homes and seek the help of the Minister for Defence, Sir
    George Pearce.</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--black">The farmers were still soldiers at heart. They knew that the only way to defeat this foe was with the best military
    power Australia had to offer. When they met Sir George Pearce, they urged the Minister to send trained military
    personnel with machine guns. The Minister agreed, and began forming a fighting force immediately.</p>
    <img class="preparation__image" src="src/img/ambush.jpg" alt="black and white photo of a group of soldiers sitting on a bank">
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--black">The Australian Anti-Emu Defense Force (AEDF) was formed. It was headed by 3 elite members: Sergeant S. McMurray, Gunner
    J. O'Hallora, and their commander Major GPW Meredith of the Seventh Heavy Battery of the Royal Australian Artillery.
    Each was armed with a Lewis gun and 10,000 rounds of ammunition.</p>

    <h1 class="heading heading--white">Skirmishes</h1>
    <h2 class="heading heading--red heading--small heading--left">First Attack</h2>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--white paragraph--no-t-margin">The AEDF planned to assault the emu battalion on the 27th of October, 1932. But Lord High Emu was no fowl. On the day
      of the planned attack, his army scattered under the cover of rain, causing the AEDF to withdraw.</p>
    <h2 class="heading heading--red heading--small heading--left">Scouting</h2>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--white paragraph--no-t-margin">The AEDF realized they could not attack head-on. Changing their strategy, they hunted a scouting group of 50 emu
      warriors and engaged them in battle. The birds were tactical and split into small groups so that they were difficult to
      target. The AEDF managed to kill several emus, but at a high cost of ammunition.</p>
    <h2 class="heading heading--red heading--small heading--left">Dambush</h2>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--white paragraph--no-t-margin">On the 4th of November, the AEDF set up an ambush spot by a local dam. The Lord High discovered their location, sending
      1000 of his warriors. They barely managed to defeat 12 emus before being forced to retreat.</p>
    <div class="skirmishes__section">
      <h2 class="heading heading--bright heading--small">Defeat</h2>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph--white paragraph--no-t-margin">Despite all the efforts of the AEDF, they were unable to stop the Emu Republic. Any attempt at a full-scale attack was
      thwarted. Any attempt at an ambush was swarmed. Any emu warriors they killed were replaced by two more. The forces
      behind the Emu Republic were relentless and unending.</p>

  <section class="public-outcry">
    <h1 class="heading heading--black heading--margin">Public Outcry</h1>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--black">The Lord High Emu turned the people against Australia, locally and abroad. Conservationists in the United Kingdom
    protested the war, calling it an "extermination of the rare emu". Dominic Serventy and Hubert Whittel, eminent
    Australian ornithologists, described the war as "an attempt at the mass destruction of the birds".</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--black">Others, for some reason (perhaps due to pro-emu propaganda), didn't take the threat seriously. The Minister for Defence
    was ridiculed and mocked by the very citizens he was trying to save.</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--black">It didn't take long for politicians to react to the outcry. The House of Representatives publicly shamed the Minister
    for Defence for his failure. Pearce withdrew the AEDF on the 8th of November, 1932.</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--black">Without the AEDF, the emus ran amok. More and more invaded by the thousands, taking everything the farmers held dear.</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--black">Pearce, realizing his grave mistake in giving to the whims of the House of Representatives, fought back and convinced
    them to redeploy the AEDF. Major Meredith was once again fighting the emu menace.</p>
    <div class="public-outcry__section">
      <p class="paragraph paragraph--white paragraph--quote">"When one New South Wales state Labor politician enquired whether ‘a medal was to be struck for those taking part in
      this war’, his federal counterpart in Western Australia, responded that they should rightly go to the emus who ‘have
      won every round so far’.”</p>

  <article class="final-battle">
    <h1 class="heading heading--white">Final Battle</h1>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--white">The final battle, better known as the Six Day Siege (despite being longer), was a last attempt at quelling the emu
    threat.</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--white">Meredith swore to do better this time. He held nothing back, and by the 2nd of December, him and his forces were
    killing 100 emus per week. But it wasn't enough. Each emu cost 10 bullets, and Meredith only had a supply of 10,000.
    There was no way to defeat 20,000 of them.</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--white">With hope gone, Meredith was recalled on the 10th of December. His forces had killed nearly 3500 emu warriors; an
    impressive number, but only a fraction of what the Emu Republic had to offer.</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--white">The war was over.</p>
    <div class="final-battle__quote">
      <p class="paragraph paragraph--gray paragraph--quote">“If we had a military division with the bullet-carrying capacity of these birds it would face any army in the world…

      <p class="paragraph paragraph--white paragraph--quote">“The machine-gunners’ dreams of point blank fire into serried masses of Emus were soon dissipated. The Emu command had
      evidently ordered guerrilla tactics, and its unwieldy army soon split up into innumerable small units that made use of
      the military equipment uneconomic. A crestfallen field force therefore withdrew from the combat area after about a
      month.”</p>

  <article class="aftermath">
    <h1 class="heading heading--black heading--margin">Aftermath</h1>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--black">The Emu Republic continued to terrorize the farmers for decades. The farmers repeatedly requested military
    intervention, but the Australian Government refused, for fear of retaliation from the Lord High Emu.</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--black">It wasn't until 1942 that hostilities ceased, after several years of peace talks and negotiations. Australia withdrew
    all military presence from Western Australia and forfeited their claim to the land, recognizing Emuland as a nation led
    by the Lord High Emu.</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--black">Emuland is currently spread across 70% of Western Australia. The emu population is continuously growing, and is
    expected to exceed the human population by 2024. Their level of development is unknown; humans are not allowed to enter
    Emuland and its Lord High Emu has become increasingly withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="paragraph paragraph--black">Some believe that another war may be on the horizon. Some believe that it is already happening. Emus are present on our
    stamps, our currency, and our national crest. Who knows where else they might appear?</p>
